### ðŸ”¹ What is CIDR?

A **CIDR block** defines an **IP address range** using the format:

```
IP_address/prefix_length
```

* The **IP\_address** is the starting point.
* The **prefix\_length** (`/16`, `/24`, etc.) tells how many bits are **fixed for the network**. The remaining bits are used for **host addresses**.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:

* Smaller `/` number â†’ **bigger network, more IPs**.
* Larger `/` number â†’ **smaller network, fewer IPs**.

### ðŸ”¹ Example from your setup

#### 1. **VPC CIDR**

```hcl
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
```

* `/16` means **first 16 bits fixed**, remaining 16 bits for hosts.
* IP range = `10.0.0.0` â†’ `10.0.255.255`.
* Total usable IPs = **65,536 addresses** (minus a few reserved by AWS).
* This is your **whole private network** in AWS.

---

#### 2. **Public Subnets**

```hcl
public_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
```

* Each `/24` gives **256 IPs** (254 usable).
* `10.0.1.0/24` â†’ IPs from `10.0.1.0` to `10.0.1.255`.
* `10.0.2.0/24` â†’ IPs from `10.0.2.0` to `10.0.2.255`.
* These sit **inside the VPC range (10.0.0.0/16)** and are carved out for **public resources** (like Load Balancer, NAT Gateway).

---

#### 3. **Private Subnets**

```hcl
private_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.3.0/24", "10.0.4.0/24"]
```

* Same idea, each `/24` = 256 IPs.
* `10.0.3.0/24` â†’ for private resources (e.g., app servers).
* `10.0.4.0/24` â†’ another private subnet, usually in a different Availability Zone for **HA (High Availability)**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ AWS Best Practices

* Always keep **VPC CIDR larger (/16 or /20)** so you donâ€™t run out of IPs.
* Subnets should be smaller chunks (/24 or /20).
* Separate **public & private subnets** for security and scalability.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to **draw a visual diagram (subnets inside VPC)** so you can clearly see how these CIDRs fit together?
